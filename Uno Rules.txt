Acquire a deck of UNO cards
Start off with 7 cards for each player (2 - 10 Players)
Multiple types of cards - Wild Card ( Changes the color of the current cycle)
- Wild Draw 4 ( Changes the color of the current cycle and makes the next player draw 4 cards) 
- Skip ( Skips the next player's turn and goes to the player after them)
- Reverse ( Switches order of players and goes back to previous player's turn)
- Draw 2 ( Makes the next player draw 2 cards from the deck and skips their turn)

The first player to get rid of all of the cards from their hand before anyone else will win.
The order of players goes in the clockwise direction unless a reverse card is played
A Player must call "Uno" when playing their next-to-last card as a warning to other players
If that player does NOT call "Uno" and is caught before the next player plays their card, they one who did not call "Uno" must draw 2 cards from the deck
If someone plays a "Draw 2" or a "Wild Draw 4" card, the next player can avoid picking X amount of cards by playing their own "Draw 2" or "Wild Draw 4"
